# Quiz 10 multiplication questions, ranging from 0x0 to 9x9. 
# If the user enters the correct answer the program displays 'correct!'  for 1 second and move on to next question
# User gets 3 tries to get it right before the program moves to next question
# 8 seconds after first displaying the question, it is marked as incorrect even if user enter a correct input after the 8-sec limit
